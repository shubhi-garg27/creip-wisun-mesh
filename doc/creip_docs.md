# Cognitive RF Environment Intelligence Platform (CREIP)

### *Self-Learning Predictive Mesh Intelligence for Next-Generation IoT Infrastructure*

---

# Project Overview

CREIP is an AI-powered wireless mesh networking platform built using Silicon Labs EFR32 devices to create smarter, more reliable, and self-adaptive IoT communication systems.

Traditional mesh networks often struggle in dynamic RF environments due to:

* interference,
* congestion,
* signal blockage,
* and unstable communication links.

CREIP introduces an edge-AI driven routing layer that continuously analyzes network conditions and predicts weak communication paths before failures occur.

The platform can:

* intelligently reroute traffic,
* optimize mesh communication,
* reduce packet loss and latency,
* and self-heal the network in real time.

CREIP also creates a Digital RF Twin to visualize network behavior, RF conditions, and node health across the infrastructure.

Unlike conventional routing systems, CREIP combines:

* predictive AI,
* RF-awareness,
* and autonomous optimization

to build a resilient and intelligent wireless ecosystem for future IoT deployments.
